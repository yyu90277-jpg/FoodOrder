              junglefowl. It is one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of more
              than 19 billion as of 2011.[1] Humans commonly keep chickens as a source of food (consuming both their
              meat and eggs) and, more rarely, as pets.</p>

            <div class="dessert">Dessert</div>
            <p class="card-text text-truncate">Dessert is a course that concludes a meal. The course usually consists of
              sweet foods, such as confections dishes or fruit, and possibly a beverage such as dessert wine or liqueur,
              however in the United States it may include coffee, cheeses, nuts, or other savory items regarded as a
              separate course elsewhere. In some parts of the world, such as much of central and western Africa, and
              most parts of China, there is no tradition of a dessert course to conclude a meal.\r\n\r\nThe term dessert
              can apply to many confections, such as biscuits, cakes, cookies, custards, gelatins, ice creams, pastries,
              pies, puddings, and sweet soups, and tarts. Fruit is also commonly found in dessert courses because of its
              naturally occurring sweetness. Some cultures sweeten foods that are more commonly savory to create
              desserts.</p>

            <p class="card-text text-truncate">Pasta is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine, with the first
              reference dating to 1154 in Sicily.\r\n\r\nAlso commonly used to refer to the variety of pasta dishes,
              pasta is typically a noodle made from an unleavened dough of a durum wheat flour mixed with water or eggs
              and formed into sheets or various shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. As an alternative for those
              wanting a different taste, or who need to avoid products containing gluten, some pastas can be made using
              rice flour in place of wheat.[3][4] Pastas may be divided into two broad categories, dried (pasta secca)
              and fresh (pasta fresca).</p>
