                        <p class="card-text text-truncate">Pork is the culinary name for meat from a domestic pig (Sus
                            scrofa domesticus). It is the most commonly consumed meat worldwide,[1] with evidence of pig
                            husbandry dating back to 5000 BC. Pork is eaten both freshly cooked and preserved. Curing
                            extends the shelf life of the pork products. Ham, smoked pork, gammon, bacon and sausage are
                            examples of preserved pork. Charcuterie is the branch of cooking devoted to prepared meat
                            products, many from pork.\r\n\r\nPork is the most popular meat in Eastern and Southeastern
                            Asia, and is also very common in the Western world, especially in Central Europe. It is
                            highly prized in Asian cuisines for its fat content and pleasant texture. Consumption of
                            pork is forbidden by Jewish and Muslim dietary law, a taboo that is deeply rooted in
                            tradition, with several suggested possible causes. The sale of pork is limited in Israel and
                            illegal in certain Muslim countries.</p>

                        <p class="card-text text-truncate">Seafood is any form of sea life regarded as food by humans.
                            Seafood prominently includes fish and shellfish. Shellfish include various species of
                            molluscs, crustaceans, and echinoderms. Historically, sea mammals such as whales and
                            dolphins have been consumed as food, though that happens to a lesser extent in modern times.
                            Edible sea plants, such as some seaweeds and microalgae, are widely eaten as seafood around
                            the world, especially in Asia (see the category of sea vegetables). In North America,
                            although not generally in the United Kingdom, the term \"seafood\" is extended to fresh
                            water organisms eaten by humans, so all edible aquatic life may be referred to as seafood.
                            For the sake of completeness, this article includes all edible aquatic life.</p>

                            A side dish, sometimes referred to as a side order, side item, or simply a side, is a food
                            item that accompanies the entrée or main course at a meal. Side dishes such as salad,
                            potatoes and bread are commonly used with main courses throughout many countries of the
                            western world. New side orders introduced within the past decade[citation needed], such as
                            rice and couscous, have grown to be quite popular throughout Europe, especially at formal
                            occasions (with couscous appearing more commonly at dinner parties with Middle Eastern
                            dishes).

                            An entrée in modern French table service and that of much of the English-speaking world
                            (apart from the United States and parts of Canada) is a dish served before the main course
                            of a meal; it may be the first dish served, or it may follow a soup or other small dish or
                            dishes. In the United States and parts of Canada, an entrée is the main dish or the only
                            dish of a meal.\r\n\r\nHistorically, the entrée was one of the stages of the “Classical
                            Order” of formal French table service of the 18th and 19th centuries. It formed a part of
                            the “first service” of the meal, which consisted of potage, hors d’œuvre, and entrée
                            (including the bouilli and relevé). The “second service” consisted of roast (rôti), salad,
                            and entremets (the entremets sometimes being separated into a “third service” of their own).
                            The final service consisted only of dessert.

                                Veganism is both the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products,
                                particularly in diet, and an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of
                                animals.[b] A follower of either the diet or the philosophy is known as a vegan
                                (pronounced /ˈviːɡən/ VEE-gən). Distinctions are sometimes made between several
                                categories of veganism. Dietary vegans (or strict vegetarians) refrain from consuming
                                animal products, not only meat but also eggs, dairy products and other animal-derived
                                substances.[c] The term ethical vegan is often applied to those who not only follow a
                                vegan diet but extend the philosophy into other areas of their lives, and oppose the use
                                of animals for any purpose.[d] Another term is environmental veganism, which refers to
                                the avoidance of animal products on the premise that the harvesting or industrial
                                farming of animals is environmentally damaging and unsustainable.

                                Vegetarianism is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of meat (red meat,
                                poultry, seafood, and the flesh of any other animal), and may also include abstention
                                from by-products of animal slaughter.\r\n\r\nVegetarianism may be adopted for various
                                reasons. Many people object to eating meat out of respect for sentient life. Such
                                ethical motivations have been codified under various religious beliefs, as well as
                                animal rights advocacy. Other motivations for vegetarianism are health-related,
                                political, environmental, cultural, aesthetic, economic, or personal preference. There
                                are variations of the diet as well: an ovo-lacto vegetarian diet includes both eggs and
                                dairy products, an ovo-vegetarian diet includes eggs but not dairy products, and a
                                lacto-vegetarian diet includes dairy products but not eggs. A vegan diet excludes all
                                animal products, including eggs and dairy. Some vegans also avoid other animal products
                                such as beeswax, leather or silk clothing, and goose-fat shoe polish.

                                domesticated from the wild goat of Southwest Asia and Eastern Europe. The goat is a
                                member of the animal family Bovidae and the subfamily Caprinae, meaning it is closely
                                related to the sheep. There are over 300 distinct breeds of goat. Goats are one of the
                                oldest domesticated species of animal, and have been used for milk, meat, fur and skins
                                across much of the world. Milk from goats is often turned into goat cheese
